    "# Kaggle Challenge - where do proteins localise?  \n",
    "Understanding where proteins localise is essential for uncovering their biological function and role in disease.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge details and description  \n",
    "This competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bbinf-26-subcell) challenges participlants to build a machine learning model that predicts the subcellular localisation of metazoan proteins based on their features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proteins can be in more than one location (mutlti label type problem)\n",
    "- Some of the proteins are natural, some are natural sequences, and some are engineered proteins\n",
    "- Inbalanced data - some compartments have many examples (like cytoplasm), while others have less (like peroxisome)\n",
    "- Protein localisation depends on many subtle factors: AA sequence motifs, signal peptides, post-translational modifications, and 3D structure. Capturing all from sequence alone is difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "Data provided in `.csv` format. The following files are provided:  \n",
    "- `train.csv` - training set\n",
    "- `test.csv` - test set  \n",
    "- `sample_submission.csv` - example of a submission in the correct format  \n",
    "- `metaData.csv` - supplementary information about the data  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission and Evaluation  \n",
    "For each protein in the test set, a line with the protein ID followed by 1 or 0 depending on if the corresponding localisation is predicted or not. Example submission file:  \n",
